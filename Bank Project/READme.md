# 📊 Banking Domain Analysis & Power BI Dashboard

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing banking domain data using an end-to-end workflow: **CSV → Python (EDA) → Power BI**.  
Using Python, detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand customer behavior, loan trends, deposit patterns, and overall banking performance.  
The results were visualized in a **4-page Power BI dashboard** covering:
- 🏠 Home Page Overview  
- 💳 Loan Analysis  
- 🏦 Deposit Analysis  
- 📄 Final Summary Page
